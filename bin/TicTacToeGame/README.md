## **Network Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
<p>
Here is the server for multiple two-player games. It listens for two clients to connect, and spawns a thread for each: the first is Player X and the second is Player O. The client and server send simple string messages back and forth to each other; messages correspond to the Tic Tac Toe protocol, which I made up for this example.
